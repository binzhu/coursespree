e-Tutor PHP Readme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
------------
e-Tutor is a suite of open source (GPL) online course tools. The
individual pieces are very simple to configure and use. They do not
require any special hardware. This release of e-Tutor is PHP/MySQL based.
It can handle multiple instructors and multiple courses, and is geared
towards expandability.

Post-Install Instructions
-------------------------
e-Tutor PHP has a fairly specific order in which things have to be done to
create a usable system. Although they are mostly intuitive, some steps may
seem strange. This is because of the model that e-Tutor has adopted, where
the Administrator should not have to do everything; it is mostly up to the
instructors of courses.

The standard usage cycle is as follows:
- Administrator installs system
- Administrator logs in
- Administrator sets system-wide Preferences
- Administrator creates "Prof"-type users
- "Prof" users log in
- "Prof" users add their courses
- "Prof" users add their students to these courses, including TA's
- "Prof" users edit the TA users to give them TA rights
- "Prof" users create assignments for the courses
- "Student" users log in
- "Student" users upload assignments
- "TA" or "Prof" users log in and download assignments

Assignments can be downloaded as either individual files, or as an 
assignment archive in ZIP format. This feature only works if the standard 
open-source "zip" program exists and is accessible from PHP.

Upon reading these steps, they should hopefully seem fairly logical. Note 
that upon setting the system up the Administrator only has to create 
"Prof"-type users, although he does have permissions to do anything a 
"Prof" user can, for any course on the system.
